Here's a Divi-Dead interpreter by SoyWiz.

Copyright status is unknown, except for smpeg which is under the LGPL.
This was the thread he created when he posted the source code :
https://foro.tales-tra.com/viewtopic.php?f=73&t=1647

The only thing he said is that he will no give any support for the source code.

I revamped the source code a bit because it was a mess and it was trying to put everything
inside of a main.c with includes and the likes...

So yeah this should be a lot more straight forward to compile & run.

Note that i removed the tools for translating and yadada...
This is only focused on the game engine part and getting the game up and running, nothing else.

The font used is Liberation Mono - Bold.

=========
Building
=========

You will need PHP (with the GD module), Wine and ffmpeg.
Make sure to compile bin2c in Utils/bin2c too.

Run compress_graphics.bat with wine (you can do so with wineconsole).
Then run ./build_graphics.sh.

Finally you can compile the resulting executable by invoking make -j.
